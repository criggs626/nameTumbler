## Name Tumbler
### General Information
I worked as a software development intern for a company called directnic and was aksed to build this site for them. The code was modified to work with an opensource API and to submit for a web app development project. The unmaintained project can be found at nametumbler.com and the original code can be found on my github. github.com/criggs626/nameTumbler/
### Description
Name Tumbler acts as the key to unlocking the best domains for you. It allows you to enter as many words as you like seperated by commas and then seperate more words on a new line and combines the words as much as possible. While combining the site will also search to see if that specific combination is available for purchase or if it is already registered.

### Combination method
Each term separated by a comma will be combined with each term of another line separated by a comma. For example the input.

>**computer, parts**

>**buy, sale**

Will search the terms

>**computerbuy.com, computersale.com, partsbuy.com, partssale.com,buycomputer.com, buyparts.com, salecomputer.com, saleparts.com**
